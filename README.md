# Alternative-Social-Media-Icons
Just some alternative social media font icons for Bitchute, Minds, Gab, and Parler. I created them using [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/app/) because FontAwesome doesn't include them. Be aware that not all icons can be used for commercial purposes and the copyright holders retain all rights. I don't own the rights to the artwork that was used to generate these icons. However, most of the licenses I looked at are for non-commercial use. I'll combine these in to a single CSS file and Font folder at some point but am putting these here if you find them useful.

## Example usage:

`<span class="icon icon-parler"></span>`

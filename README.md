# Alternative-Social-Media-Icons

![Alt-Social-Icons](img/screenshot.png)

Just some alternative social media font icons for Bitchute, Minds, Gab, and Parler. I created them using [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/app/) because FontAwesome doesn't include them. Be aware that not all icons can be used for commercial purposes and the copyright holders retain all rights. I don't own the rights to the artwork that was used to generate these icons. However, most of the licenses I looked at are for non-commercial use. I hope you find them useful.

## Example usage:

`<span class="icon icon-parler"></span>`

## Licenses 

- I'll include some license information soon regarding the authors of the artwork and their websites. So to be on the safe side only use them for non-commercial purposes to promote your social media.
